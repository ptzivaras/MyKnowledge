Requirements? Missing I dont know what to add here. TBC.
 Problem? how to take account the party size,
 cause party size is importan if worried about available seating so how many tables or capacity how many peolle can it fit?
Business Logic? Example when a table is reserved how much time is it? Cause when can a party go and finish dinner until its
                free for next one? This is business Logic.
