i use xamarin forms aand i want this thing to do. I press a button i xaml front end code and it ll pass a value to a view model that i have connected to the back code

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you can pass a value from a button in XAML to a ViewModel in Xamarin.Forms:

In your XAML file, create a button and add an event handler for the "Clicked" event. Inside the event handler, call a method on your ViewModel and pass the desired value as a parameter. Here's an example:
php
Copy code
<Button Text="Press me" Clicked="Button_Clicked" />
In your code-behind file (e.g. MainPage.xaml.cs), implement the event handler method. Inside the method, you can access the ViewModel by setting the BindingContext property of the current page to an instance of your ViewModel class. Then, call a method on the ViewModel and pass the desired value as a parameter. Here's an example:
csharp
Copy code
private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var viewModel = BindingContext as MyViewModel;
    viewModel.SetValue("my value");
}
In your ViewModel class, create a method that takes the desired value as a parameter. Inside the method, you can do whatever you need to with the value (e.g. store it in a property, update a database, etc.). Here's an example:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyViewModel
{
    public void SetValue(string value)
    {
        // Do something with the value (e.g. store it in a property)
    }
}
That's it! Now, when the button is clicked, it will call the event handler method in your code-behind file, which will then call a method on your ViewModel and pass the desired value as a parameter.

and if that value that i pass is binded to a grind and i say like in the grid i say isenabled = that value if the value is false then grid id disabled but is it that simple that i bind that valye to grid ?
Yes, it is possible to bind the value that you passed from the button click to the IsEnabled property of a grid in your XAML file. Here's how you can do it:

Create a public property in your ViewModel that represents the value you passed from the button click. Let's call it "IsGridEnabled" for this example:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyViewModel
{
    public bool IsGridEnabled { get; set; }
    
    public void SetValue(bool value)
    {
        IsGridEnabled = value;
    }
}
In your XAML file, add the grid and bind its IsEnabled property to the "IsGridEnabled" property of your ViewModel. Here's an example:
php
Copy code
<Grid IsEnabled="{Binding IsGridEnabled}">
    <!-- Add grid content here -->
</Grid>
In your event handler method for the button click, update the value of the "IsGridEnabled" property on your ViewModel. Here's an example:
csharp
Copy code
private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var viewModel = BindingContext as MyViewModel;
    viewModel.SetValue(false); // Set the value to false to disable the grid
}
That's it! Now, when you click the button, it will update the "IsGridEnabled" property on your ViewModel, which will in turn update the IsEnabled property of the grid in your XAML file. If the value is false, the grid will be disabled.

and why it works it takes the value but grid is not disabled?
If the binding is not working and the grid is not being disabled, there are a few things you can check:

Make sure that the BindingContext of your XAML page is set to an instance of your ViewModel. You can do this in the constructor of your XAML page, like this:
scss
Copy code
public MyPage()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    BindingContext = new MyViewModel();
}
Make sure that the "IsGridEnabled" property of your ViewModel is raising the PropertyChanged event when its value changes. This is important because it tells the UI to update the binding. You can do this by implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface in your ViewModel and raising the PropertyChanged event in the property setter, like this:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private bool _isGridEnabled;
    public bool IsGridEnabled 
    {
        get { return _isGridEnabled; }
        set 
        { 
            _isGridEnabled = value;
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(IsGridEnabled)));
        }
    }
    
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
    
    public void SetValue(bool value)
    {
        IsGridEnabled = value;
    }
}
Check the Output window in Visual Studio for any binding errors. If there are any errors, they will be logged in the Output window when you run the app. Look for any messages related to the binding of the IsEnabled property.
If you still can't figure out why the binding is not working, you can try adding a breakpoint in the IsGridEnabled property setter in your ViewModel and see if it is getting called when you click the button. If it is not getting called, there may be an issue with the event handling or the binding setup.
